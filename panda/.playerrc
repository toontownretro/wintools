# This file should be imported by your .bashrc when you launch the terminal.
# It sets up necessary environment variables and executes the WINTOOLS setup
# script, which sets up further necessary things.

# You can add any other environment variables and commands you would like to be
# executed when you launch the terminal.

# Invoke the WINTOOLS startup script.  This further bootstraps our environment
# and attached us to WINTOOLS.
source $WINTOOLS/attach/wintools.sh

# You can add other automatic attachments here.  Note that if you attach to
# a tree low in the hierarchy, all the the parent trees will automatically be
# attached to as well.  For instance, cta toontown will also attach you to
# ttmodels, otp, dmodels, direct, and panda, which pretty much covers
# everything.
