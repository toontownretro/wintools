# wintools

`wintools` is the most foundational repository of the Player.  It contains scripts to set up and interact with the development environment, as well as CMake scripts to build and install the thirdparty packages required to build the Player.  It is originally derived from [this repository](https://github.com/rdb/panda3d-thirdparty).

Build and setup instructions are [here](https://github.com/toontownretro/documentation/blob/main/docs/getting_started/setup_player.md#toontown-retro-building--setup-guide).
